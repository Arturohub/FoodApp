I decided to start the path of becoming a full stack developer on Monday 8th January 2024. 
Web designing and developing was something I always wanted to learn, so I decided to go for it full time. 
This tutorial was done during the first week of February, just after I finished learning HTML and CSS and finish my other project "Furniture Shop Website". 
This tutorial helped me to learn how to fetch data from APIs (in this particular case, Spoonacular API), how to work with React, how environment variables work and a big etc etc
