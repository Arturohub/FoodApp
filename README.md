I decided to start the path of becoming a full stack developer on Monday 8th January 2024.

Web designing and developing was something I always wanted to learn, so I decided to go for it full time.

This tutorial was done during the second week of February, just after I finished learning how to use React and React Hooks with my previous project "ToDo App".

This tutorial helped me to learn how to fetch data from APIs (in this particular case, Spoonacular API), how to work with React, how environment variables work and a big etc etc.

In short, this is an app where you can input search any query and a list of recipes will be fetched from the API, containing the ingredients and the instructions, as well as other informations.

It is quite useful for those days where you are hungry and don't know what to eat hehe
